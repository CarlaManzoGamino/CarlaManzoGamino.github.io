        <p class="lead mb-4">As an 18-year-old freshman at the University of California, Riverside (UCR), I'm excited to embark on my journey as a psychology major. The transition from high school to college has been both thrilling and challenging, but I'm already falling in love with the vibrant campus community and the endless opportunities that lie ahead.
When I first started considering colleges, UCR wasn't initially on my radar. However, after researching various programs and visiting the campus, I was drawn to the university's strong psychology department and its commitment to undergraduate research.
My decision to major in psychology stemmed from a fascination with human behavior and a desire to understand the complexities of the mind. In high school, I volunteered at a local internship program, which sparked my interest in mental health and counseling as I worked closely with kids from different backgrounds. This experience, combined with my natural inclination towards empathy and problem-solving, made psychology feel like the perfect fit for my academic and career goals.
Moving into my dorm at UCR was a mix of excitement and nervousness. The campus felt enormous compared to my high school, and I was initially overwhelmed by the sheer number of new faces and experiences. However, the welcoming atmosphere during orientation week helped ease my anxiety. I quickly bonded with my roommates, Briana and Jazmin, although they have different majors, we've become fast friends.
The first few weeks of classes were a whirlwind of activity. I found myself juggling introductory psychology courses, general education requirements, and the social aspects of college life. The workload was significantly more demanding than high school, but I was pleasantly surprised by how engaging the material was, especially in my psychology classes.
As a psychology major at UCR, I've been impressed by the breadth and depth of the curriculum. The department offers both Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees in psychology, and I'm currently on the B.A. track. However, I'm considering switching to the B.S. program as I become more interested in research methodology and theory.
My favorite class so far has been Introduction to Psychology, which has provided a comprehensive overview of the field. The professor, Dr. Sy, is not only knowledgeable but also passionate about the subject, making even the most complex concepts accessible and interesting. We've covered topics ranging from personality and cognition to social psychology and abnormal behavior, and each lecture leaves me more excited about my chosen field.
One aspect of UCR's psychology program that I particularly appreciate is its emphasis on scientific research. Even as a freshman, I've been encouraged to think critically and approach psychological concepts with a scientific mindset.
<br><br>

        While my experience at UCR has been overwhelmingly positive, it hasn't been without its challenges. The transition to college-level coursework was initially daunting, and I had to quickly develop better time management and study skills. I found the Academic Resource Center incredibly helpful in this regard, offering workshops on note-taking, exam preparation, and other essential academic skills.
Another challenge has been navigating the larger class sizes, especially in some of the general education courses. Coming from a small high school, it took some time to adjust to lecture halls with hundreds of students. However, I've learned to be proactive in seeking help during office hours and forming study groups with classmates.
<br><br>

        As I continue my journey at UCR, I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I'm particularly looking forward to taking more specialized psychology courses, such as Cognitive Psychology and Social Psychology. I'm also eager to delve deeper into research, hopefully securing a position in a lab by the end of my sophomore year.
Long-term, I'm considering pursuing a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology. UCR's strong graduate program in psychology is an inspiration, and I hope to gain more insight into graduate school life through interactions with current Ph.D. students and faculty members.
